so when ever you are using tailwind and you want to add things that tailwind doesnt have currently on its config
just set its mode to jit,

=> mode: "jit" [aka, just in time compilation]

then you can use things like

=> m-[-50vw] || w-[50vw]
which is what i wanted to use in my Input, but couldnt cuz tailwind css's max width is only w-96, which is just 24 rem

seems like i dont even need to add mode: "jit"
also the reason why i wasnt able to use tailwind wasnt because it no electricity or no wifi, its because the config was not correct, i had to add the config 
content: [
    "./elements/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
  ],

had to tell tailwind that the elements inside elements are also in need for tailwind so yeah. the code works brilliantly now!

adding more> and less> in a text section:
typically i think you should have been able to add 

-webkit-line-clamp: 4; //for 4 lines max
-webkit-box-orient: vertical; 

and this would limit your line to only 4 at max and it would have been fine, tara nope! not in my condition mate. the line-clamp shit doent even work mate.
then on click you would remove the limit then add it again, on click on less>

# RESOLVED
- Seems like you can do it you just need to set the height and width of your component, if its inside any display property, give it 100% or any amount of size you want.
then on the desc....

hell nah, thats not it, you could add it already, it seems like i just didnt know how, should have just added line-clamp-4 using tailwind css in the <p> it seems like...
i.e. just this:
.line-clamp-4 {
    overflow: hidden;
    display: -webkit-box;
    -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
    -webkit-line-clamp: 4;
}

with this my header is done for, i need to work on its responsiveness, later!

part 2 [Navbar Section]
=======

- yeah it seems like its 100vh with 10vh navbar, 60vh books 30vh events right?
lets get to it I guess.

========
part 3 [Books below Navbar && rendering them conditionally]
========

- so what you do is, you just map the navbar then just like the how i had rendered info of A
particular book on click, you just do that, pass the navId to the book section then according to the id 
display the information of the section from the navbar.

- work on the new arrivals display part
    - add the info of all the books to be displayed in the helper folder then map them then use grid to display
    all of them in 5x2 format
