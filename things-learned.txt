so when ever you are using tailwind and you want to add things that tailwind doesnt have currently on its config
just set its mode to jit,

=> mode: "jit" [aka, just in time compilation]

then you can use things like

=> m-[-50vw] || w-[50vw]
which is what i wanted to use in my Input, but couldnt cuz tailwind css's max width is only w-96, which is just 24 rem
